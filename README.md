# @addepar/style-toolbox

This package collects a set of fonts and scss style files which are used by
various applications at Addepar

Using this dependency is not best practice. Internal Addepar codebases should
defer to Addepar's design system and APL design tokens for a style baseline and
font configuration.

# Installation

# Install via npm/yarn like anything else
npm install --save-dev @addepar/style-toolbox

This package is published without a build. You can rely on paths as they are
