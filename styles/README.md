# Addepar Style Toolbox

### Core
The `core` directly contains all of the very basic design elements of the
Addepar brand. The `core` directory contains:
- core-variables
- utilities
- elements

### Addepar Classic
The `adpr-classic` directly is where all styling related to Addepar's UI2
interface is kept. The `adpr-classic` directory contains:
- core-variables (should be importing from `core`)
- utilities
- elements
- components
- layouts
