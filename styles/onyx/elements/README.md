# Elements | Addepar Classic

The `onyx/elements` directory contains all of the "Addepar Classic Theme" styling that is applied to HTML elements. The `elements` directory should contain all visual styling of elements that do not have state changes.

### What is the difference between an element and component?
Components are elements on the page that a user can interact with, and will provide the user with a state change after the user action. Whereas elements are static visual elements that a user can interact with, but will not recieve a state change.

### Disclaimer
It's important to understand that all changes made to this directory will affect the Addepar Classic Theme globally. If you are modifying or removing elements from this directory, please make sure these changes have been signed off by somebody on the Product Design Team.
